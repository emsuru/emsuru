### üë©‚Äçüíª Are we **a good professional fit**? 

My career is twisty and spans almost 20 years. I spent roughly half of these in the creative sector and half in business. I hope to spend the next decade in tech & science. Over the years I changed fields but maintained professional interest in research, design, development, human connection.

Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirunasuru/) if you want to know more or want to work with me.

### üì∫ Are we **a good cultural fit**? 

I'm driven by intellectual curiosity. I put high personal value on open knowledge for all and open access to information. In human interaction I value transparency, authenticity, direct communication and generosity. My interests are broad, some of them are: cognitive science, comedy and ethics. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/em_suru).
