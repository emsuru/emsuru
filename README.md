## Hi there, I'm Em! üëã

I'm currently learning data science with Python. Have a look at my latest project repos: 

- End-to-end ML project, from data collection through to deployment:
  - [my data collector](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-01-data-collection) (solo) shows I can build my own dataset for ML
  - [my data explorer](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-02-data-analysis) (solo) shows I can do EDA (exploratory data analysis)
  - [my ML price predictor](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-03-ML-model-development) (solo) shows I can train an ML model
  - [my ML API](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-04-ML-deployment) (solo) shows I can deploy an ML model via an API endpoint

- A personal project:
  - [my spotify grapher](https://github.com/emsuru/spotify-grapher) (solo) shows I can work with Pandas & Matplotlib for data manipulation & viz
    
- My first ever 3 Python projects:
  - [my randomizer](https://github.com/emsuru/openspace-organizer) (solo) shows I can write OOP code
  - [my duo scraper](https://github.com/emsuru/duo-scraper) (solo) shows I've got web scraping skills
  - [our data collector](https://github.com/karelrduran/Immo-Data-Collection.git) (collab) shows I can play nice & code in a team

### üë©‚Äçüíª Are we **a good professional fit**? 

My career is twisty and spans almost 20 years. I spent roughly half of these in the creative sector and half in business. I hope to spend the next decade in tech & science. Over the years I changed fields but maintained **professional interest** in research, design, development, human connection.

Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirunasuru/) if you want to know more or want to work with me.

### üì∫ Are we **a good cultural fit**? 

I'm driven by intellectual curiosity. I put high personal value on open knowledge for all and open access to information. In human interaction I value transparency, authenticity, direct communication and generosity. My **personal interests** are broad, some of them are: cognitive science, comedy and ethics. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/em_suru).
