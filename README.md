## Hi y'all! 👋

I'm currently learning python, back-end, automation and data science.

All my repos are learner repos atm:

- two school projects:
  - [my duo scraper](https://github.com/emsuru/duo-scraper) shows I've got web scraping skills
  - [my randomizer](https://github.com/emsuru/openspace-organizer) shows I can write OOP code
    
- one personal project:
  - [my spotify grapher](https://github.com/emsuru/spotify-grapher) shows I can work with Pandas data frames for data manipulation & analysis
